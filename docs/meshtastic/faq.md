## New User Expectations
It is important to know that Meshtastic is under rapid development, and is not yet a *polished* product. There are bugs and quirks but that is part of the fun. If you have just turned on your Meshtastic device for the first time, get it in a good location (being next to a window can help) and let it run overnight. It takes time to see other nodes, and for other nodes to see you. Some users choose to share their position (GPS or fixed coordinates) which will appear on the maps. There are a few public maps available showing nodes (that choose to share their position) but we use [https://meshtastic.davekeogh.com/](https://meshtastic.davekeogh.com/).


##FAQ's

* **How do I know if I am connected to the mesh?**
    1. Seeing other nodes appear in your node list is a good indicator.
    1. Allow your node to run overnight and search for it (long name, short name, or either ID string) on the [webmap](https://meshtastic.davekeogh.com/).
* **Why am I not getting any responses to my messages sent in LongFast or Direct Messages?**
    1. The mesh is (currently) a fairly quiet place. We do have a [weekly net](/meshtastic/#weekly-net). This doesn't mean that you are not connected.
    1. Many nodes are unmonitored and just serve to connect the mesh. We encourage use of "ðŸ“µ" in the long name to indicate this.
* **I am not seeing any other nodes on my list, even after running overnight.**
    1. Make sure your node is somewhere it can signal, near a window can be a good place.
    1. Ensure your region is set (Choose "US") on the settings tab of the app.
    1. Check the steps listed under "How do I know if I am connected to the mesh?" above.
* **My node keeps rebooting, or having other apparent issues.**
    1. Try reflashing your node again, and then try older firmware versions. This may take several attempts.
